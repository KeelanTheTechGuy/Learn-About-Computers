    <h1>Introduction to Programming</h1>
    
    <p>Computers follow instructions written in special languages called programming languages. Learning to code allows you to create websites, apps, games, and much more!</p>

    <h2>What is a Programming Language?</h2>
    
    <p>Programming languages help us communicate with computers. Some common languages include:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Python</strong> - Simple and beginner-friendly</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> - Used for websites</li>
        <li><strong>Java</strong> - Popular for software development</li>
        <li><strong>C++</strong> - Used for games and high-performance programs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Basic Code Example</h2>
    
    <p>Here’s a simple program in Python:</p>
    
    <code>
        print("Hello, world!")
    </code>

    <p>This code makes the computer display the words "Hello, world!"</p>

    <h2>Why Learn to Code?</h2>
    
    <p>Coding allows you to build amazing things, solve problems, and even get great job opportunities!</p>
    
    <p>Give it a try—you might love it!</p>
